Xist16 is a library for the Commander X16 computer to aid the development of C programs for the CX16 by providing an abstraction layer and convenience functions for many common graphical operations that games need to perform, such as loading and managing graphical data, animating sprites and tiles, and displaying text. It also provides some minor conveniences for handling user input, and a pseudorandom number generator. Xist16 is made for C programs compiled using the cc65 compiler suite.

The goal of this library is to jump-\/start the development of games (and other graphics-\/intensive software) by providing plug-\/and-\/play functionality for these fundamental, common requirements so that developers donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel and develop their own solutions.

This doxygen-\/generated documentation includes detailed technical information about all of the macros, global variables, and function signatures contained in the header files (i.\+e., the API reference). For additional detailed documentation, including installation instructions and a quickstart guide, see the {\ttfamily Xist16\+Manual.\+pdf} in the {\ttfamily docs} folder.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{License}{License}}\label{index_install_sec}
