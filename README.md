# Xist16

Xist16 is a library for the Commander X16 computer to aid the development of C programs for the CX16 by providing an abstraction layer and convenience functions for many common graphical operations that games need to perform, such as loading and managing graphical data, animating sprites and tiles, and displaying text. It also provides some minor conveniences for handling user input, and a pseudorandom number generator. Xist16 is made for C programs compiled using the cc65 compiler suite.

The goal of this library is to jump-start the development of games (and other graphics-intensive software) by providing plug-and-play functionality for these fundamental, common requirements so that developers donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel and develop their own solutions.

## Getting Started

Please view the Xist16Manual.pdf file in the docs folder for installation instructions and a thorough tutorial-like explanation for how to use this library to jump-start the development of Commander X16 games written in C using the cc65 compiler suite. You will also find Doxygen documentation in the docs folder.
